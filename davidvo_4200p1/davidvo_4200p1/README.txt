How to compile my program:
1. The program asks for user's input 1, 2, or 3. [1] option is for solving a single puzzle, [2] is for solving more than 1 puzzles, and [3] is to exit/terminate the program.
2. Within [1] option, it gives user 2 options. [1] is for generating random puzzles and [2] is for user to enter or copy-paste their puzzle.
3. After that, it asks user to enter the solution depth (any number from 2-20).
4. Lastly, it will asks which Heuristic user want to user. Enter [1] for H1 and [2] for H2.
5. After its done, the program will loop to the beginning.
6. Within [2] option (Multi-Test Puzzle), it will ask the exact same questions as Single Test Puzzle option, but in different order. The only new question it will ask is to enter the number of puzzles to solve if the user pick the generate random puzzles option.

Note that the random puzzle generator will literally generate random puzzles which might or might not be solved based on the user's solution depth.
